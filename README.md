## 1. Business Problem
Two entrepreneurs decided to go into the fashion business with an E-commerce business model. The initial idea is to enter the market with just one product and for a specific audience, in this case the product would be jeans for the male audience. The goal is to keep the cost of operation low and scale as customers are acquired. However, even with the entry product and the target audience defined, the two partners have no experience in this fashion market and therefore do not know how to define basic things such as price, the type of pants and the material for the manufacture of each piece.

Thus, the two partners hired a Data Science consultancy to answer the following questions:
1. What is the best selling price for the pants?
2. How many types of pants and their colors for the initial product?
3. What raw materials are needed to make the pants?

## 2. Solution Strategy
- **Step 1. Data collect:** Web scraping done on the [H&M clothing store website](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/men/products/jeans.html);
- **Step 2: Data cleaning:** This step consisted of cleaning the data so that it could be stored properly;
- **Step 3: Database:** Save clean data to a relational database.
